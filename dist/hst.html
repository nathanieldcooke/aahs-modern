        <p>Your physician has ordered this test to evaluate you for Sleep Apnea, a condition where you stop breathing during sleep. An individual with this condition may not even be aware of it. Untreated, sleep apnea can lead to excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, as well as serious health problems such as high blood pressure, heart problems, diabetes and stroke. However, some patients with risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea and other medical disorders may not be appropriate for a home sleep testing. <span id="bold">HOME TESTING IS NOT RECOMMENDED FOR THOSE WITH:  Central Sleep Apnea, CHF - Congestive Heart Failure, Chronic Opiate or Narcotic Use, COPD – Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, Cognitive Impairment, Emphysema, Idiopathic Hypersomnia, Epilepsy,  Morbid Obesity - (BMI greater than 45), Narcolepsy, Neuromuscular Disease, Pulmonary Hypertension, Seizures, & Stroke.</span> We ask patients with any of the above diagnoses to immediately notify At Home Sleep Studies staff (702) 463-8062 and we will confirm with your physician appropriateness of home sleep testing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Please conduct and return your Home Sleep Test promptly as other patients are scheduled and waiting to be tested using the same recorder. Your physician has been notified of your scheduled sleep test and will be waiting for your final test results. This type of sleep test allows you to sleep in the comfort of your own home while a machine collects information. Go to bed at your normal bedtime and try to sleep in bed for 6 hours. If you don't get at least four hours of sleep or experience other difficulties, call At Home Sleep Studies (702) 463-8062.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span id="red">IF YOU EXPERIENCE A MEDICAL EMERGENCY SUCH AS CHEST PAIN, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NUMBNESS OR PAIN IN LEFT ARM, OR A DEBILITATING HEADACHE OR OTHER LIFE-THREATENING CONCERN, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY.</span></p>
        <br>
        <p>Once you complete your home sleep test please return the device back to At Home Sleep Studies between 9am to 11am unless other pickup arrangements have been scheduled. At Home Sleep Studies provides only the diagnostic portion of your sleep study. This means you will not be seen by or be in direct communication with our sleep physicians. Your results are reviewed by our board-certified sleep specialist and the final sleep report will be faxed to your physician. Your health care provider will review the sleep study results with you and map out a plan of action for your sleep disorder and symptoms.  Do Not Call At Home Sleep Studies For Sleep Results. We Recommend That You Schedule An Appointment With Your Ordering Physician One Week After Your Home Sleep Test To Review Your Results.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You have the right to voice grievances or complaints regarding treatment or care that is (or Fails to be) furnished and lack of respect of property by anyone who is providing care on behalf of At Home Sleep Studies and will not be subjected to discrimination or  reprisal for doing so. If you would like to report a grievance, complaint or concern you may file a verbal or written complaint to phone number or address above.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We make every effort to promote a quality and comfortable testing experience. We recognize that this testing may includes new experiences that you do not commonly endure when you sleep in your own home. However, we appreciate your feedback on your home sleep testing experience and look forward to working on improving our patient home sleep testing.</p>
