          <h2>About Your Sleep Test</h2>
        </div>
        
        <div id="part1">
          <img src="./img/inlab-p1.jpeg" alt="family cuddling">
          <p>Your physician has prescribed an Overnight Sleep Study (Polysomnogram) to evaluate your sleep complaints or underlining concerns.  A Polysomnogram (PSG) is a diagnostic recording of physical activities that occur while you are sleeping. Several small sensors will be placed on your body to monitor eye movements, brain waves, muscle activity, heart rate, airflow, respiratory effort and your oxygen level throughout the night.  These small sensors allow our certified technicians to record your necessary sleep data. Although the small sensors will be secured to your body for the entire night, you still are able to use the restroom if needed during your sleep study.</p>
          <br>
          <p>If your physician prescribed an Overnight Sleep Study with Titration, you may be asked to wear a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) mask along with the small sensors.  This mask delivers pressurized air, which helps keep the breathing passages open during sleep. Although the small sensors will be secured to your body and you are wearing a CPAP mask, you still are able to use the restroom if needed during your sleep study.</p>

        <h3>What to Expect</h3>
        <div id="p-a">
          <img src="./img/inlab-p2.jpeg" alt="">
          <p id="a">When you arrive for your study, the technologist will apply the monitoring devices. This should take approximately 45 minutes. You will sleep in a private bedroom, and are able to get up as much as you need throughout the night to use the restroom. Your room has a TV for you to watch before bedtime. You are also welcome to bring a book or magazine. We provide bedding, including sheets, blankets and pillows. The study usually ends between 4 and 5 a.m. the following morning. The technologist is not permitted to discuss your test results or make any treatment recommendations.</p>
          <p id="b">Please follow up with your physician to discuss the results of your sleep test. Results will be available after fourteen business days. Thank you for your patience while we prepare for your care and contact your insurance.</p>
